# DeeperDepthEstimation

# Introduction 
This is my clear implementation for ["**Depth from a Single Image by Harmonizing Overcomplete Local Network Predictions**," 
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07081) NIPS 2016.

Note : this implementation is only for the inference code, I'm looking forward to training this model but i have some issues regarding my GPU capacity.

Note : 
If you are interested in Depth Estimation, I recommend you to have a look into ["**DepthEstimationVGG**," 
](https://github.com/MahmoudSelmy/DepthEstimationVGG/blob/master/README.md).
